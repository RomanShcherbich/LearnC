# Installation of Long Term Supported OpenJDK

Long Term Supported (LTS) versions of OpenJDK are crucial for several reasons:

Stability: LTS versions are designed to be stable and reliable. They receive updates and bug fixes over an extended period, ensuring that they remain robust and secure.

Security: Regular updates to LTS versions include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities. This is essential for maintaining the security of applications running on the JVM.

Support: LTS versions are supported by the community and vendors for a longer duration compared to non-LTS versions. This means developers and organizations can rely on consistent support and updates.

Compatibility: Using an LTS version ensures compatibility with a wide range of libraries, frameworks, and tools that are also designed to work with these stable releases.

Predictability: Organizations can plan their development and deployment cycles around the predictable release and support schedules of LTS versions, reducing the risk of unexpected changes and disruptions.

In summary, LTS versions of OpenJDK provide a stable, secure, and supported environment for developing and running Java applications, making them a preferred choice for many developers and organizations.
